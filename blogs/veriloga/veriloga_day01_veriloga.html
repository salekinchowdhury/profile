    `include "discipline.h" // Include Verilog-A libraries
    `include "constants.h"  // Include fundamental constants
    
    module simple_resistor (p, n); // Module definition for a resistor with nodes p and n
        electrical p, n; // Declare electrical nodes p and n
        parameter real R = 1k; // Resistor value set to 1k ohms
    
        analog begin // Analog block for behavior definition
            I(p, n) <+ V(p, n) / R; // Current defined by Ohm's Law: I = V/R
