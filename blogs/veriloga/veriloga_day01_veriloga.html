    <h3>Imagine This...</h3>
    <p>Picture yourself in a lab, surrounded by oscilloscopes and circuit boards. You have an idea for a new analog filter. Instead of reaching for your soldering iron, you sit down at your computer and write a few lines of Verilog-A. Suddenly, your concept transforms into a dynamic model that you can simulate. The thrill of creation without the mess!</p>
    
    <h2>Getting Started with Verilog-A</h2>
    <p>Ready to dive in? Here’s a simple example to get you started:</p>

  
    <pre><code> 
    `include "discipline.h" // Include Verilog-A libraries
    `include "constants.h"  // Include fundamental constants
    
    module simple_resistor (p, n); // Module definition for a resistor with nodes p and n
        electrical p, n; // Declare electrical nodes p and n
        parameter real R = 1k; // Resistor value set to 1k ohms
    
        analog begin // Analog block for behavior definition
            I(p, n) <+ V(p, n) / R; // Current defined by Ohm's Law: I = V/R
        end
    endmodule // End of simple_resistor module
    </code></pre>

  
    <p>In this snippet, we define a simple resistor module. It captures the essence of Ohm’s Law in just a few lines—simple, right?</p>
