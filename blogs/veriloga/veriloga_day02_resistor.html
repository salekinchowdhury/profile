        <section>
            <p>Welcome to Day 2 of our Verilog-A adventure! If you're like me, every time you crack open a new code or model, you get a little thrill from seeing how something as basic as a resistor can make a world of difference in circuit design. But donâ€™t worry, weâ€™re going to ease into this. Today, youâ€™ll create your first Verilog-A model for a humble resistor.</p>

            <h2>Step 1: Crafting Your Verilog-A Resistor Model</h2>
            <p>Before you ask, "What's the big deal with a resistor?", think of it like that quiet friend who doesnâ€™t say much but keeps everything chill at the party. Without it, circuits would just be chaotic noise, like a room full of toddlers after cake.</p>
            
            <pre><code>
`include "constants.vams"   // Include Verilog-A libraries
`include "disciplines.vams" // Include fundamental constants

module simple_resistor(p, n);
    inout p, n;               // Analog ports
    electrical p, n;          // Declare these ports as electrical signals
  
    parameter real R = 1k;    // Parameter for resistance value

    analog begin
        V(p, n) <+ I(p, n) * R;  // Ohm's law: V = IR
    end
endmodule
           </code></pre>
            
            <p>Boom! You just wrote your first Verilog-A model! If you felt a spark of joy, thatâ€™s because youâ€™re now officially speaking the language of analog design.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Save the file as <code>simple_resistor.va</code>.</strong> Youâ€™ll want to remember this filename like you remember your phoneâ€™s PINâ€”itâ€™ll come in handy soon.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: Simulation in Cadence Virtuoso</h2>
            <p>Now that you've got the magic code, let's see it come to life in <strong>Cadence Virtuoso</strong>. If youâ€™ve ever worked in a lab, you know that this is the moment where you hook things up and cross your fingers.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Launch <strong>Virtuoso</strong>.</li>
                <li>Create a new libraryâ€”letâ€™s call it something like <strong>VerilogA_salekinl</strong>. Shhh! Don't get caught copying me!</li>
                <li>Write the Verilog-A code for your resistor model, and save it in a cell named <strong>simple_resistor</strong>.</li>
                <li>Create a schematic with a DC voltage source and connect it to your new Verilog-A resistor.</li>
                <li>Open <strong>ADE Explorer</strong>, select <strong>DC Analysis</strong>, and plot the voltage and current. Run the simulation and enjoy that moment when your resistor behaves exactly as it should.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <blockquote>Itâ€™s like watching a slow-motion high-five between current and voltage. ðŸ™Œ</blockquote>

            <h2>Step 3: Simulation in Spectre (Terminal-Based)</h2>
            <p>Want to feel like a circuit magician? Time to summon Spectre. Terminal-based simulation is like driving stick shiftâ€”itâ€™s not always necessary, but boy does it feel cool.</p>
            
            <pre><code>
simulator lang=spectre // Sets the simulator language to Spectre
global 0 // Defines global node '0' as ground
                
I0 (net1 0) simple_resistor R=1000 // Instantiates resistor I0 with resistance of 1000 ohms, connected between 'net1' and ground
                                   // You can change the "R" value to any resistance value
                                   // Remember this line? "parameter real R = 1k;" You made "R" a varible.
                                   // Damn! This line makes more sense now
V0 (net1 0) vsource dc=800.0m type=dc // Instantiates a DC voltage source V0 with 800 mV, connected between 'net1' and ground

// (Start) Copy paste the bottom lines as it is for every spectre simulation
simulatorOptions options psfversion="1.4.0" reltol=1e-3 vabstol=1e-6 \

save I0:p   // Saves the current through the positive terminal of instance I0 (the resistor)
saveOptions options save=allpub // Saves all public signals (voltages, currents) in the circuit
ahdl_include "~/VerilogA_salekin/simple_resistor/veriloga/veriloga.va" // Includes the Verilog-A file for the simple resistor model
</code></pre>
            
<p>Youâ€™ve got your testbench. Now, to run the simulation:</p>

<pre><code>spectre testbench.scs</code></pre>
            
            <p>Check your results using <strong>Virtuoso Visualization & Analysis XL</strong> (<code>viva</code>). This is the part where you feel like a wizard in front of a crystal ball, except you're looking at graphs of voltage and current. Seriously satisfying.</p>
        </section>

            <p>Well! I know this code looks intimidating, isn't it? Fear not, you can generate the Spectre code from ADE directly! Here is how:</p>

            <p>Well, you can see, you can generate the Hspice testbench as well! However it is important to know the syntax so that you can write the stimuli by yourself! </p>

            <h2>Step 4: Simulation in HSPICE</h2>
            <p>No blog series on Verilog-A is complete without a little <strong>HSPICE</strong> action. Itâ€™s like bringing out the vintage vinylâ€”HSPICE has been around, and it knows its stuff.</p>
            
<pre><code>
.PROBE DC               ; Set up to probe (measure) DC values in the circuit.
+    I(xi0:p)          ; Measure the current flowing through the port 'p' of the instance 'xi0'.
.DC                     ; Start a DC sweep analysis.
.TEMP 25                ; Set the temperature for the simulation to 25 degrees Celsius.
.OPTION                 ; Define simulation options.
+    ivthn=300e-9      ; Set the threshold voltage for NMOS transistors to 300 mV.
+    ivthp=70e-9       ; Set the threshold voltage for PMOS transistors to 70 mV.
+    ARTIST=2          ; Specify the artist parameter for visual representation (simulation results).
+    INGOLD=2          ; Set the integration method to a specific type (method 2).
+    PARHIER=LOCAL     ; Use local parameter hierarchy for the simulation.
+    PSF=2             ; Set the precision for the state function to level 2.
xi0 net1 0 simple_resistor R=1e3 ; Define an instance 'xi0' of a simple resistor connected between 'net1' and ground (0) with resistance of 1 kÎ©.
v0 net1 0 DC=800e-3    ; Define a DC voltage source 'v0' connected between 'net1' and ground (0) supplying 800 mV.
.hdl "~/VerilogA_salekin/simple_resistor/veriloga/veriloga.va" ; Specify the path to the Verilog-A HDL file for the simple resistor model.
.END                    ; End of the simulation description.                
</code></pre>

            <p>Now, to run the simulation:</p>
            
            <pre><code>hspice resistor_tb.sp > output.log</code></pre>
            
            <p>Use <strong>Virtuoso Visualization & Analysis XL</strong> again to check out your waveforms. Itâ€™s always a good moment when HSPICE gives you the thumbs up.</p>

            <h2>Wrap-Up</h2>
            <p>By now, youâ€™ve not only written your first Verilog-A model, but youâ€™ve also simulated it in three different ways: <strong>Virtuoso</strong>, <strong>Spectre</strong>, and <strong>HSPICE</strong>. Each step is like adding a new layer to your circuit-design superpowers.</p>
            <p>In the next part, weâ€™ll dig deeper into the Verilog-A universe, but for now, pat yourself on the back. Youâ€™ve come a long way from that blank editor screen.</p>
