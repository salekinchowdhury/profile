        <p>Welcome back! Yesterday, we met the 'quiet friend' of circuits—a simple resistor in Verilog-A. Today, we’re diving a little deeper into the structure of a Verilog-A module, the “anatomy” that powers its functionality. Imagine it like understanding the framework behind a favorite recipe. Instead of focusing on ingredients alone, we're looking at the entire process.</p>
    </section>
    
    <h2>Understanding the Structure of a Module</h2>
    
    <p>A Verilog-A module typically includes several key elements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Library Includes:</strong> Always start by including the necessary libraries to access fundamental constants and disciplines.</li>
        <li><strong>Module Declaration:</strong> This is where you define the module name and its ports.</li>
        <li><strong>Parameter Declaration:</strong> Use parameters to customize your model, just like adjusting the size of a wrench to fit different nuts and bolts.</li>
        <li><strong>Analog Block:</strong> Here’s where the magic happens! You define the behavior of your module, similar to how you would decide which tool to use for a task.</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h2>Step 1: Crafting a Verilog-A Model for an RC Circuit</h2>
    <p>Let’s take our resistor knowledge and add a new ingredient: a capacitor. When you connect these two in series, you get an RC circuit that’s fantastic for smoothing signals. Here’s how it looks in code:</p>

    <pre><code>
`include "disciplines.vams" // Include fundamental constants
`include "constants.vams"   // Include Verilog-A libraries
module rc_circuit(p, n);        // Declare module with two ports 'p' and 'n'
  inout p, n;                   // Define 'p' and 'n' as analog ports
  electrical p, n, mid;         // Declare nodes 'p', 'n', and 'mid' as electrical

  parameter real R = 1k;        // Set resistance (1k ohm by default)
  parameter real C = 1n;        // Set capacitance (1 nF by default)

  analog begin
    I(p, mid) <+ V(p, mid) / R; // Current through resistor (I = V / R)
    I(mid, n) <+ ddt(C * V(mid, n)); // Current through capacitor (I = C * dV/dt)
  end
endmodule
    </code></pre>

    <p>This model builds a basic RC circuit. The resistor’s behavior is governed by Ohm’s law (current = voltage / resistance), while the capacitor’s behavior is a little more dynamic, responding to the change in voltage over time. It’s like a sponge filling up with water at a rate determined by the input current.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Simulating the RC Circuit in Virtuoso’s ADE Explorer</h2>
    <p>Ready to bring it to life? Fire up <strong>ADE Explorer</strong> in Cadence Virtuoso:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a new cell for <code>rc_circuit</code> and paste in your Verilog-A code.</li>
        <li>Design a schematic with a "pulse voltage source" connected to <code>p</code> and ground on <code>n</code>. The circuit should look like this!</li>

        <li>Open <strong>ADE Explorer</strong> and set up a transient analysis to observe the capacitor charging and discharging over time. Here is the maestro view from ADE Explorer.</li>

        <li>Plot the voltage across the capacitor and the circuit current in <strong>Virtuoso Visualization & Analysis XL</strong> after running the simulation. You should see the capacitor voltage curve and current plot as expected. Considering the Resistance of 1 KΩ and capacitance of 1 nF, the output voltage should settle to almost the supply voltage (VDD) after 5τ (time constants). As you can see from the graph that at 5 µs, the capacitor voltage is almost equal to the VDD. Additionally, the capacitor voltage reaches to half of the VDD at 0.693τ! (Fun fact: Once in an interview, I was asked when the capacitor voltage reaches to half of VDD, I could not answer and as expected was not selected! Failure gives you a great lesson, isn't it?)</li>

    </ol>
    <p>Watching the capacitor voltage rise and settle feels like observing a wave calm after the initial energy burst—a real-life view of electrical behavior.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Understanding the 'Guts' of the Circuit</h2>
    <p>The 'guts' (core parts) here include the resistor and capacitor, each controlled by parameters <code>R</code> and <code>C</code>. We use Verilog-A's <code>ddt()</code> function to model the capacitor, where <code>ddt()</code> represents the derivative over time. Picture it as capturing the steepness of a hill as you go up or down; here, it measures how the capacitor’s voltage changes.</p>

    <h2>Wrap-Up</h2>
    <p>In Day 3, you’ve taken a closer look at how Verilog-A modules are structured and gained hands-on experience simulating a real circuit. Tomorrow, in Day 4, we’ll dive into understanding ports and electrical nodes in Verilog-A to get even closer to how these circuits connect and work together. Excited? Stay tuned!</p>
