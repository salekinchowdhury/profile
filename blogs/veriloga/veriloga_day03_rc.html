        <p>Welcome back! Yesterday, we met the 'quiet friend' of circuits‚Äîa simple resistor in Verilog-A. Today, we‚Äôre diving a little deeper into the structure of a Verilog-A module, the ‚Äúanatomy‚Äù that powers its functionality. Imagine it like understanding the framework behind a favorite recipe. Instead of focusing on ingredients alone, we're looking at the entire process.</p>
    </section>
    
    <h2>Understanding the Structure of a Module</h2>
    
    <p>A Verilog-A module typically includes several key elements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Library Includes:</strong> Always start by including the necessary libraries to access fundamental constants and disciplines.</li>
        <li><strong>Module Declaration:</strong> This is where you define the module name and its ports.</li>
        <li><strong>Parameter Declaration:</strong> Use parameters to customize your model, just like adjusting the size of a wrench to fit different nuts and bolts.</li>
        <li><strong>Analog Block:</strong> Here‚Äôs where the magic happens! You define the behavior of your module, similar to how you would decide which tool to use for a task.</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h2>Step 1: Crafting a Verilog-A Model for an RC Circuit</h2>
    <p>Let‚Äôs take our resistor knowledge and add a new ingredient: a capacitor. When you connect these two in series, you get an RC circuit that‚Äôs fantastic for smoothing signals. Here‚Äôs how it looks in code:</p>

    <pre><code>
`include "disciplines.vams" // Include fundamental constants
`include "constants.vams"   // Include Verilog-A libraries
module rc_circuit(p, n);        // Declare module with two ports 'p' and 'n'
  inout p, n;                   // Define 'p' and 'n' as analog ports
  electrical p, n, mid;         // Declare nodes 'p', 'n', and 'mid' as electrical

  parameter real R = 1k;        // Set resistance (1k ohm by default)
  parameter real C = 1n;        // Set capacitance (1 nF by default)

  analog begin
    I(p, mid) <+ V(p, mid) / R; // Current through resistor (I = V / R)
    I(mid, n) <+ ddt(C * V(mid, n)); // Current through capacitor (I = C * dV/dt)
  end
endmodule
    </code></pre>

    <p>This model builds a basic RC circuit. The resistor‚Äôs behavior is governed by Ohm‚Äôs law (current = voltage / resistance), while the capacitor‚Äôs behavior is a little more dynamic, responding to the change in voltage over time. It‚Äôs like a sponge filling up with water at a rate determined by the input current.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Simulating the RC Circuit in Virtuoso‚Äôs ADE Explorer</h2>
    <p>Ready to bring it to life? Fire up <strong>ADE Explorer</strong> in Cadence Virtuoso:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a new cell for <code>rc_circuit</code> and paste in your Verilog-A code.</li>
        <li>Design a schematic with a "pulse voltage source" connected to <code>p</code> and ground on <code>n</code>. The circuit should look like this!</li>

        <li>Open <strong>ADE Explorer</strong> and set up a transient analysis to observe the capacitor charging and discharging over time. Here is the maestro view from ADE Explorer.</li>

        <li>Plot the voltage across the capacitor and the circuit current in <strong>Virtuoso Visualization & Analysis XL</strong>. After running the simulation, you should see the plots for capacitor voltage and current just as expected. With a resistance of 1 KŒ© and a capacitance of 1 nF, the output voltage should nearly reach the supply voltage (VDD) after 5œÑ (time constants). As shown in the graph, by 5 ¬µs, the capacitor voltage is almost at VDD. Interestingly, the capacitor voltage hits half of VDD at 0.693œÑ! (Fun fact: I once faced an interview question about when the capacitor voltage reaches half of VDD, and I blanked out! Unsurprisingly, I wasn‚Äôt selected. But hey, failure teaches you valuable lessons, right?)
        
        </li>
       <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salekinchowdhury/profile/master/files/veriloga/veriloga_day03_rc/1k1n_plots.png" alt="RC plot" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">     
       <li>
           
           I can already hear the question brewing in your mind: 'How can I tweak the values of my RC network here?' Great question! All you need to do is hit <code>q</code> on the <code>rc_circuit</code> schematic and choose <code>CDF Parameter of View</code> as <code>veriloga</code>. Voil√†! Now you can change the values of R and C to your heart's content. And do you know why these options are available? Oh, I know you guessed it! It‚Äôs because, while crafting your Verilog-A code, you cleverly used the <code>parameter</code> keywords for R and C, setting default values of 1k and 1n respectively. This is how it all comes together in Virtuoso!

        <li>
            
            And finally, I changed the value of the Resistor to 2 KŒ©. As expected, with the increased time constant, the capacitor voltage will take more time to reach to VDD. Check out the below plots to satisfy your insatiable mind üòâ

    </ol>
    <p>Watching the capacitor voltage rise and settle feels like observing a wave calm after the initial energy burst‚Äîa real-life view of electrical behavior.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Understanding the 'Guts' of the Circuit</h2>
    <p>The 'guts' (core parts) here include the resistor and capacitor, each controlled by parameters <code>R</code> and <code>C</code>. We use Verilog-A's <code>ddt()</code> function to model the capacitor, where <code>ddt()</code> represents the derivative over time. Picture it as capturing the steepness of a hill as you go up or down; here, it measures how the capacitor‚Äôs voltage changes.</p>

    <h2>Wrap-Up</h2>
    <p>In Day 3, you‚Äôve taken a closer look at how Verilog-A modules are structured and gained hands-on experience simulating a real circuit. Tomorrow, in Day 4, we‚Äôll dive into understanding ports and electrical nodes in Verilog-A to get even closer to how these circuits connect and work together. Excited? Stay tuned!</p>
