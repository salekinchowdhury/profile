🎓 I'm a second-year PhD student at Virginia Tech.

⚡ My research interests include Analog Mixed-Signal Integrated Circuits, Neuromorphic Computing, AI Hardware Accelerators, and In-Memory Computing.

💡 I love designing circuits with the same passion and precision as Leonardo da Vinci brought to his masterpieces.

🎯 Taking on challenges and fulfilling them isn't just work—it's an addiction that drives me forward.
